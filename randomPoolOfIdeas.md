# RANDOM POOL OF IDEAS
- Alerts, like activate notifications, or dangerous alerts, or please don't leave our website alert when trying to exit
- Big paragraph of random words like *Download here to stream watch the movie that downloads 720p streaming download high speed high quality fast...*
- Ad or download button that is actually a cloth that you can move and under it is a button that when clicked, a void opens up and absorbs everything from the page. Then something happens...
- Something that when broken, releases flies everywhere on the page with sound, covering everything else. You then need something to catch them back and put them somewhere.
- Tom cruise is actually stuck somewhere on the page 
- Machinery behind the page becomes apparent in some way? 
- Click on streaming button, opens a pop-up with universal video starting, then pauses and Congratulations pop up with confetti appears, you are the 5-billionth person to stream this movie, choose one of the three gifts. Would love for that to become a shooter of some kind. Or elsewhere maybe
- Classic but everything breaks down to the bottom of the screen like physics but then the user has to replace all the elements at their place? 
- Is it like open-world type of thing? Could be interesting to have a sort of narrative where you need to do certain things before having access to others? Objects or passwords or other things. 

- NEW VERSION OF IDEAS SINCE THIS BECAME MORE OF A GAME -
- Ad "Women is 38 but looks 18 because of simple trick, Dermatologist hate her." when clicking, big pop up with keyhole, you need key to open but if you do, this is where the shooter happens. The dermatologist is evil and you have to save the women from him by shooting the dermatologist several times. Women turns around and looks beautiful and sparkly. She gives you one of the "cornes d'or" (things you have to accumulate to unlock the final puzzle).
- Ending : Page explodes completely with fire explosions and buttons and words and everything all over the place. Tom Cruise face appears fade-in and talks to say that you succeeded in downloading the movie. The file then automatically downloads. It is a movie file saying that it is illegal to download movies on the internet. Monologue about streaming? ..... Would be nice to have a sort of message in there. Text + robot voice.
