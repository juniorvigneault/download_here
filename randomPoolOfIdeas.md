# RANDOM POOL OF IDEAS
- Alerts, like activate notifications, or dangerous alerts, or please don't leave our website alert when trying to exit
- Big paragraph of random words like *Download here to stream watch the movie that downloads 720p streaming download high speed high quality fast...*
- Ad or download button that is actually a cloth that you can move and under it is a button that when clicked, a void opens up and absorbs everything from the page. Then something happens...
- Something that when broken, releases flies everywhere on the page with sound, covering everything else. You then need something to catch them back and put them somewhere.
- Tom cruise is actually stuck somewhere on the page 
- Machinery behind the page becomes apparent in some way? 
- Click on streaming button, opens a pop-up with universal video starting, then pauses and Congratulations pop up with confetti appears, you are the 5-billionth person to stream this movie, choose one of the three gifts. Would love for that to become a shooter of some kind. Or elsewhere maybe
- Classic but everything breaks down to the bottom of the screen like physics but then the user has to replace all the elements at their place? 
- Is it like open-world type of thing? Could be interesting to have a sort of narrative where you need to do certain things before having access to others? Objects or passwords or other things.
