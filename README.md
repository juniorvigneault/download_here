Examining the comedic potential of interaction design through pirate websites.

[Random Pool of Ideas](randomPoolOfIdeas.md)

### June 2nd 2023

I created a simple template for my webpage. When creating websites, I'm usually not using CSS grids and flexboxes because I always want to make something weirder, and those sorts of "perfect" templates feel a bit tacky and very "internety" to me, but here I'm diving in and actually learning how to build a proper HTML/CSS page, which is nice.

I'm trying to keep everything clear and properly named and organized because I know that when I want to break things apart or play with movement and physics, it will be hell if everything is not under control. I'll probably spend a bit more time than I thought making the base of the page so that it can be easily manipulated moving forward, and that I can easily add features. Something I want to create is a *[random pool of ideas](randomPoolOfIdeas.md)*, where I'll be writing down ideas of things I could add on the page while building it. I won't do everything on there, but I don't want to forget certain things.
