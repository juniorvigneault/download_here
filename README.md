Examining the comedic potential of interaction design through pirate websites.

I created a simple template for my webpage. When creating websites, I'm usually not using CSS grids and flexboxes because I always want to make something weirder, and those sorts of "perfect" templates feel a bit tacky and very "internety" to me, but here I'm diving in and actually learning how to build a proper HTML/CSS page, which is nice.

I'm trying to keep everything clear and properly named and organized because I know that when I want to break things apart or play with movement and physics, it will be hell if everything is not under control. I'll probably spend a bit more time than I thought making the base of the page so that it can be easily manipulated moving forward, and that I can easily add features. Something I want to create is a _[random pool of ideas](randomPoolOfIdeas.md)_, where I'll be writing down ideas of things I could add on the page while building it. I won't do everything on there, but I don't want to forget certain things.

Brainstorm 2 :
The user arrives on the webpage that ressembles a classic streaming/torrent movie page. A modal pop-up appears welcoming the user? I feel like this would need an intro but maybe not now... Maybe let the user explore and find something first. Maybe at first whatever the user clicks on (buttons, ads...) just flashes the page red with a sound... Or it just opens a pop up with an add? Yes I think that could be interesting. All the buttons have pop-ups with puzzles that will be useful in order to complete the "mission". Some are required to be done before the other (they need an object or something in order to make the one happen). So yeah things are "confusing" at first. The user uncovers a mystery hole that if clicked on, grows to engulf the whole screen. This is the first step and sort of introduction. It starts with the video of universal and then lags and opens a pop-up with a riddle. You obtain an object. Objects can be seen in a menu that you can open. You can drag these objects onto stuff. The user goes back to the page and solves different puzzles. At one point an alarm rings and a timer in red starts to go down. A bomb will make the webpage explode if the user does not complete the mission in time.
